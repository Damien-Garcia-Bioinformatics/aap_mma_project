# aap_mma_project
Mutualised project between "Advanced Algorithmic and Programming" and "Models, Methods and Programming". Project about alignment of sequences

# Objectives
- Implementation of Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithm (MSA).
- Construction of tree and MSA in parallele to facilitate access of data.
- Makefile for compilation.
- Python script (pipeline) to execute sequence of algorithms.
- 20 datasets containing each 20 sequences.

# Questions
- How does the complexity of the sequences impact the complexity of the alignment, the execution time (...)?

## Main goals

Three objectives :

1. Alignment algorithm

2. Scoring/test function

3. Data generation

These may not be developed in this order, as generated data will be needed for running the algorithm, with a specific grammar.

The scoring function can be developed once the generated data is implemented, and at the same time as the alignment algorithm.
