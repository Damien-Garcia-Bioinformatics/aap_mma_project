## Main goals

Three objectives :

1. Alignment algorithm

2. Scoring/test function

3. Data generation

These may not be developed in this order, as generated data will be needed for running the algorithm, with a specific grammar.

The scoring function can be developed once the generated data is implemented, and at the same time as the alignment algorithm.
